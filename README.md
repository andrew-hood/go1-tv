# Getting Started with the Go1 TV App

This project was an experiment to see what the experience would be like if Go1 had a tv app. The design was inspired by youtube's tv app design. Check out the live project here.

## Features

- Keyboard navigation
- Drawer and carousel animations
- Graphql queries
- Go1 Authentication

## Development

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
